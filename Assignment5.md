## Question 1: Which team has the highest salary cap and the lowest salary cap?

From Pro Football Reference, I first transfered the Players Salaries table to CSV. Using Text to columns, I separated the table into several columns. Under Player name, there was a backslash and something I didn't recognize and thought it was useless (Kirk Cousins\CousKi00). So I separated it into two columns using backslash as the divider, then deleted the newly separated column.
To find the highest salary cap team and the lowest salary cap team, I used the Pivot Table and put the Teams in Rows and Average of Cap Hit in Values. I then sorted it through average. Then using Sort, I found that the Atlanta Falcons were hit with the most salary cap and the Indianapolis Colts were hit with the lowest.

## Question 2: From the two teams with the highest salary and lowest salary, who are the three players who are paid the most and the least?

I went back to Sheet 1 and used Filter to categorize them. Under teams, I unclicked Select All and just clicked on ATL. I found out that Quarterback Matt Ryan ($15,750,000), Wide Receiver Julio Jones ($11.500.000), and Defensive tackle Dontari Poe ($7,500,000) were the three highest player. Running Back terrence Magee (253,232), Wide Receiver Marvin Hall ($328,236), and Defensive Tackle Tani Tupou ($328,236) were paid the least.

For the Colts, Defensive Back Vontae Davis ($9,000,000), Wide Receiver T.Y. Hilton ($8,000,000), and Running Back Frank Gore ($3,500,000) were the highest paid players. The lowest paid players were Wide Receiver Krishawn Hogan ($38,294), Strong Safety Ronald martin ($72,353), and Wide Receiver Matt hazel (95,294)

*After I saw the numbers, I remembered that Quarterback Andrew Luck wasn't included in this list because he suffered a season-ending injury in 2017 and his salary cap didn't count. I did wonder how much the Colts would have been hit by the cap if Luck's salary did count.

## Question 3 The conventional thinking is that Left Tackles get paid the 2nd most behind the Quarterback because they protect the quarterback's (usually, assuming the quarterback is right-handed) blindside. Just from trying to answer Question 2, I thought it was interesting that the 2nd highest player for the Colts and the Falcons weren't left tackles. So, in how many teams are left tackles the second highest paid position?

Of the 32 NFL teams, only 3 teams had their tackle as the 2nd highest player's salary cap hit in 2017. They are the Baltimore Ravens, Miami Dolphins, and the Oakland Raiders. I used the Filter tool to figure this out. It was interesting to see that there were more teams (4) who's highest position salary cap hit was the offensive lineman (Buffalo Bills, Cleveland Browns, New England Patriots, Philadelphia Eagles)

*It should be noted that the amount of cap hit and the amount of money the players get paid are different (For example, Tom Brady's salary cap hit for the Patriots is just $1 million. Brady does not get paid just $1 million).
