There are 23 teams in the MLS. I would look at the record and compare miles (or kilometers) run by players in the top half teams during games and compare them to those in the bottom half teams. When I gather all the data, I'm hoping to find some data that stands out. For instance, how does the miles run differ by positions or by formations, if any? Is there a certain position who tends to run more than others?  | There are 23 teams in the MLS.

**I know this is rough, but with the Citi Open happening in DC, if this works out, perhaps I can go to the tournament and get some quotes from the players.
