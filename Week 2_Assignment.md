## In Major League Soccer, do players who play for top teams cover more ground than those who play for teams with worse record?
There are 23 teams in the MLS. I would look at the record and compare miles (or kilometers) run by players in the top half teams during games and compare them to those in the bottom half teams. When I gather all the data, I'm hoping to find some data that stands out. For instance, how does the miles run differ by positions or by formations, if any? Is there a certain position who tends to run more than others?

**If this works out, perhaps I can get some DC United people for interviews.


## Do tennis players who serve with higher velocity more likely to earn points than serving with less velocity?
Even casual fans know that players who are serving have the advantage in that point. By just how much of an advantage do they have? For this, I would look at serve velocity of the players (both male and female). I'm hoping to find the average velocity. And if players served above that velocity in their point, did they win that point or lose? To start, I would look at a season or the major touraments

**I know this is rough, but with the Citi Open happening in DC, if this works out, perhaps I can go to the tournament and get some quotes from the players.
