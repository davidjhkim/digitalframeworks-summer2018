I would like to know if there is a correlation between the kilometers run by soccer players per game and the record of those players' teams.The more the players run, the better the team record? Or is there no correlation at all?

Here are the features I will be collecting:

1. Opponent (Is the team playing a strong team or a weak team?)
1. Number of minutes played by the player 
1. Game start time (Are they running in the hot sun, which could impact their physical condition?)
1.
