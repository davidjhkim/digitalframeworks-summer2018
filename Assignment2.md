I would like to know if there is a correlation between the kilometers run by soccer players per game and the record of those players' teams. The more the players run, the better the team record? Or is there no correlation at all?

Here are the features I will be collecting:

* Opponent (Is the team playing a strong team or a weak team?)
* Number of minutes played by the player (You would probably run less than others if you are subbed in/out)
* Game start time (Are they running in the hot sun, which could impact their physical condition?)
* Overtime/PK 
* Weather/Temperature (SImilar to game start time, weather plays a factor in conditioning)
* Score (If a team is getting blown out, players in that team might not be willing to run more as opposed to when the score is tight)
* Distance run by players


Player | Position | Opponent | Minutes Played | Game Start Time | Overtime | Temperature | Humidity | Final Score | Distance Run
-------| ---------| -------- | ---------------|-----------------|----------|-------------|----------|-------------|--------------
Wayne Rooney | Forward | Vancouver Whitecaps| 32minutes | 8:00pm | No | 88/79 F | 48% |  3-1|  tk*     
Yamil Asad | Midfieilder | Vancouver Whitecaps| 89minutes | 8:00pm | NO | 88/79 F |48% | 3-1 tk*


* I'm currently in contact with STATS, which collects data of how many kilometers players run. I'm hoping to get hands on the data soon. 
I will check weather.gov for temperature and cross-reference ESPN and MLS website for game statistics.
