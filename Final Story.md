After Seattle Seahawks kicker Blair Walsh missed a 39-yard field against the visiting Washington Redskins, the Redskins started their drive in the 29-yard line. Led by quarterback Kirk Cousins, the underdog Redskins marched through the field, dissecting the Legion of Boom secondary. 

Throughout the drive, the Redskins utilized Chris Thompson in the backfield, a dual-threat running back who has very good hands as well. But once the team was inside the 10-yard line, the Florida State-product was nowhere to be seen. He was replaced by Rob “Fat Rob” Kelley. 

At the 10-yard line, Kelley rushed for five yards from a shotgun formation. After the Seahawks were called for a pass interference penalty that placed the ball at the one-yard line, the Redskins got in their goal line power formation—six offensive linemen, two tight ends on each side and a fullback—with Kelley. Kelley rushed twice to get into the endzone, taking a 7-2 lead during a Week 8 game last season.

Although the NFL has become a passing-friendly league, teams often employ old-school strategy in the red zone, especially within five and 10 yards. Teams tend to switch to their power formation and rush heavier running backs to pound the defense, attempting to score a touchdown like the Redskins did against the Seahawks. 

“A lot of it just has to do with physics,” said St. Olaf’s College football team head coach James Kilian. “You get a bigger guy moving as hard as you can and the momentum takes you forward.”  

But further look at the numbers—specifically rushing touchdown plays—show that the conventional wisdom might not be correct. Last season, rushing touchdowns occurred 380 times during the regular season. Of those 380 plays, 309 of them were scored by running backs or fullbacks (Others were by quarterback, wide receiver, and a defensive tackle—an indication that coaches believe bigger runners have a better chance of getting into the endzone than smaller runners. The DT was Buffalo Bills’ Kyle Williams). Using weight listed at NFL Pro-Reference, the average weight of those running backs and fullbacks who scored a touchdown is 218.17 lbs. The numbers range from 181 lbs (Chicago Bears’ Tarik Cohen) to 261 lbs (Tennessee Titans’ Jalston Fowler). 

Of the 309 rushing touchdowns scored by running backs and fullbacks, more than 60 percent of the plays—191 to be exact— occurred between the one- and five-yard line. The average of the players who scored in those 191 plays is 219.87lbs, a little over one-pound difference—and an inconsequential one.

So why are some coaches, in today’s games where West Coast offense are dominant, determined to pound the ball when their team is close to the goal line?

"Because down there, the vertical passing game shrinks,” said Monmouth College’s football team head coach Chad Braun said. “There’s not much of a vertical threat down there because the field shrinks and you’re not able to run deeper routes.”

While spread offense can be effective when marching down the field, it may not be the most useful formation. Most famously, at Super Bowl XLIX, the Seahawks, down 28-24, attempted a pass with 25 seconds left in the game, which was intercepted by New England Patriots’ Malcolm Butler. Seattle head coach Pete Carroll was heavily criticized for not using Marshawn Lynch, one of the most fierce running backs in NFL history, at the goal line. 

“In that case, Malcolm made an incredible play,” Braun said. “Because they were all spread out, the threat to run with Marshawn Lynch was still there. I don’t think it was a mistake. They did what gave them the best chance to win and every once in a while, the other team makes a great play and you gotta tip your hat off to them.”

Good luck telling Seahawks fans that.

So, what, then, is the best way to score within five yards?

The answer isn’t that simple; ask 10 different people, you could get 10 different answers. The answers may vary based on the team’s personnel, the opponent’s personnel, the situation of the game and others.

For Braun, the answer depends on who his quarterback is.

“Three years ago, in 2016, we had a quarterback who was 6-4, 230. We put him back there and ran wildcats with him and just let him plow,” Braun said. “Last year, we were different. We threw some two tight-ends and put our linebacker in the fullback position and lead the way.”

Kilian has a different thought.

“If you made me choose, I would go with the heavier personnel group, but have the flexibility in your formation so you’re not always doing it one way,” he said. “If you got a really good wide receiver and they’re playing man coverage, awesome. Have your other nine guys in protection where the ball is being snapped and play catch with your best receiver against a defensive back.”

Kilian’s strategy might work if your team has 6-foot-4 A.J. Green or 6-foot-3 Julio Jones and Larry Fitzgerald. But if not, employing a linebacker or a defensive lineman as a running back, thereby creating more force and momentum—even if the statistics don’t say so—might be the best way.

“I just think sometimes those guys just have smash-mouth mentality that they can bring to the offensive side, which can be a big addition,” Braun said. “We had a defensive tackle, who was about 5’9 260 pounds last year who’s pretty athletic and he smashed some people.”

So if you want to hoard heavier-than-average running backs in your fantasy football league in the hopes that they score more touchdowns than lighter-than-average running backs, do some homework before you make your selections. If that heavier-than-average running back has an outstanding wide receiver, a mobile quarterback, or a quarterback with great play-action motion, that running back might not bring you many points.
