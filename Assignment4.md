I plan to analyze if heavier running backs tend to score more touchdowns from the goal line than the lighter running backs. Head coaches and offensive coodinators tend to use power formation near the goal line, thus using heavier running backs to run the ball. I would like to see if that conventional wisdom actually does hold true.

To do this, I will use data from NFL.com, Pro-Football Refernece and other trustworthy sites. I will check all the rushing touchdowns in the past few years scored by running backs from the 5-yard line or shorter. And I will check the weight of all those running backs who scored.

For visualization, 

The story is timely with the football season starting soon in the first week of September and preseason starting next week. This could have fantasy/gambling implication as well. If it does turn out that heavier running backs score goal-line touchdowns, although they might not get a lot of yardage, they could be valuable in fantasy leagues (since touchdowns are usually worth 6 points). As for gambling, it's probably not going to happen this year. But in the future, if in-game gambling is legal, people can bet accordlingly
