# In English Premier League, do players who play for top teams cover more ground than those who play for teams with worse record?
### There are 20 teams in the EPL. I would look at the record and compare miles (or kilometers) run by players in the top 10 teams and compare them to the bottom 20 teams. When I gather all the data, I'm hoping to find some data that stands out. For instance, how does the miles run differ by positions or by fomrations? 


# Do tennis players who serve with higher velocity more likely to earn points than serving with less velocity?
