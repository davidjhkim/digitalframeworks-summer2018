## Soccer

### Clarity and Accuracy
This story is headlined [How Far Do You Run in a Soccer Game?](https://www.active.com/soccer/articles/how-far-do-you-run-during-a-soccer-game-872900) The article, very briefly, talks about history of measuring players' distance run and which positions tend to run more than the other. On a scale, I would give it a 3. It definitely wasn't excellent or thorugh. But technically, it did answer the question, just not specifically. 

To be honest, there wasn't much to navigate. There weren't data or graphs or pictures to display the statistics. It was just all words. I would give it a 1. For improvements, I would suggest presenting the data in a more easily-consumable way.

I definitely think the minimal data presented in the story was accurate, considering what I know about the sport, But there was no source presented. I think more data needs to be presented too. I would give it a 2.

### Quality
I would give a 1.5. There was no graphic presented, making it difficult to consume and understand the data. There was no comparison to other sports, which many stories like this and this do. The author does explain, in words, what some of the data indicates, which I appreciated. 

### Type and Color
Not Applicable

### Creativity
There was no creativity. I would rate the effetivess 1. There wasn't that much intricate data presented and I have no idea where the author got the information.



## Tennis

### Clarity and Accuracy

I would give it a 5. [The story](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-secret-to-nadals-dominance-on-clay/) clearly provides reasons why Nadal is so good on clay courts, using data from his second-serve to illustrate his dominance. The headline is The Scret to Nadal's Dominance on Clay, which the author answers.

I was able to fairly quickly understand how I would navigate the data, though if you weren't reading the story and you just looked at the data, you wouldn't understand why the author was presenting those data. I would give it a 4. But the data that the author *did* provide, I found it very helpful, comparing Nadal's data to that of other athletes. 

I don't watch that much tennis, but Nadal's performance on clay court is famous for even casual fans. I don't doubt his dominance and the reason for his dominance after reading this article. The author also provided the source. Also, there were many links I can go to if I want to know the source or more about certain information/data, something that FiveThirtyEight does very well. I would give it a 5.

### Quality

I would rate it a 4. The data presented was easy to consume. The author compares Nadal's seond-serve points won to those of other players. The one part I was confused by was the bar graph, the first infographic, I was a bit confused with the orange bars and thought it could have been presented in a better way. Nonetheless, all the data presented informed readers the reason for nadal's dominance on clay courts.  

### Type and Color

I didn't have any issue with the type and font. Perhaps it's because I fairly regularly read FiveThirtyEight, so I'm used to the font. But in the end, I thought they were well-used

I thought the one use of color was nice. At first, I thought the color orange was used because it's FiveThirtyEight color. And then I realized it's the same color as clay. Subtle, but very nice. I would gie it a 5.

### Creativity

I would give it a 4 and not a 5, only because I wasn't blown away by it. In terms of creativeness, I thought the author did a nice job presenting not just that he wins a lot of second-serve point, but how it helps Nadal actually win it. For instance, the author presents a video to demonstrate that his serve puts him in a good position on the court to easily win the point.
