Purpose: To only see data of those entering 1st grade, whose birthday was in January and OLSAT verbal score was between 20 and 25

1. First, the background highlighting was annoying so I got rid of that
1. Since, this file is only supposed to consist of test scores from 2018, I got rid of 2017 data (Row 2)
1. Using the filter, for "Entering Grade Level" column, I only selected grade level 1, which was only 26 data points out of 99
1. THere is a data point where OLSAT Verbal score was missing. I selected the row and deleted it.
1. I then put the OLSAT Verbal Score in ascending order
1. I highlighted all the rows that were not 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 and deleted them.
1. I didn't want to have any slashes, especially under the column "School Preferences." So, I instered a column next to it. Then I selected column J and clicked Text to Column. After putting "/" as the deliminator, the column splited. I labeled the new column as School Preferences 2.
