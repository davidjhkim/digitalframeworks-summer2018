## Documentation

1. Under the column "School Assigned," I wanted to fill all the blanks with "None." So I first typed "none" somewhere and copied it. Then, I highlighted that column. I typed go to under help and under Find & Select, I clicked Go to special, and clicked on the blank box. All the blanks were selected and I just pasted it, so they all filled with blanks. 
1. In the first column, there are three missing dates consecutively. So I typed N/A in the first one and dragged it to the second and third one to fill it. 
1. I didn't want any slashes in School Preferences. So I added a column right next to it. I highlighted the School Preferences column, clicked Text to Columns. I put "/" in the deliminator, moving all the right portion of the "/" to the new column. I labeled it School Preferences 2.
I only want test dates from 2018. Row 2 says 2017. My guess is that it's a typo because the dates 3/27 seem to be when a lot of the testing happened. Just in case, I clicked Find and Replace. Under Find What, I typed 2017. Under Replace with, I typed 2018. There was only one case of there being 2018.
